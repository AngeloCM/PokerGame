<h1>Description</h1>
<p>A dynamic Poker game in Unity for two players, one being an AI opponent. Players can "Check," "Fold," "Call," or "Raise" in rounds to win with the highest poker hand. Enjoy immersive gameplay and challenge your poker skills.</p>

<h3>Core Mechanics</h3>
<h2>Check:</h2>
<p>Players can choose to "Check" when they want to pass the current betting round without increasing their wager. This allows them to stay in the game without committing more chips.</p>

<h2>Fold:</h2>
<p>If a player believes their hand is weak or unfavorable, they can "Fold" to exit the current round, losing any chips they've already bet.</p>

<h2>Call:</h2>
<p>When a player wants to match the current bet placed by their opponent, they can "Call." This action keeps them in the game and ensures they're eligible to win the pot.</p>

<h2>Raise:</h2>
<p>To increase the stakes and challenge their opponents, players can "Raise." This action requires them to increase their bet, prompting other players to match or fold. It adds a layer of strategy and tension to the game.</p>
